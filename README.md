##  Data Cleaning Steps

The following cleaning steps were applied:

 Removed Duplicates**  
   Checked and eliminated duplicate records based on `Order ID`.

 **Standardized Coffee & Roast Types**  
   Matched short codes (`Exc`, `Rob`) with full names (`Excelsa`, `Robusta`).

 **Formatted Columns**  
   - Converted `Order Date` to date format  
   - Extracted numerical values from `Size`  
  
 **Reconciled Redundancies**  
   Ensured `Coffee Type` and `Coffeetyp` matched appropriately, same for roast columns.
